 Pop-used to delete the element from the stack | Front-used to delete the element from the queue| 
 Stack does not have any type | Queue has various type like general,circular and doubly queue |   
  In Stack has only one pointer is used. ie,Top of the stack| In Queue has two different pointer are used. ie,REAR,FRONT |
